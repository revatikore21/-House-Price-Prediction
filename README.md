# House-Price-Prediction-USING MACHINE LEARNING

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features such as location, number of bedrooms, square footage, etc. using different regression techniques. Real estate pricing can be difficult to estimate, and this project aims to develop an accurate machine learning model to help potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions. The primary objective of the project is to minimize the error between predicted and actual house prices.

## Objective
Predict house prices efficiently with respect to customer budgets and preferences.
Develop a model that predicts property costs based on various features.
Minimize the error (RMSE/MSE) between predicted and actual house prices.

## Methodology
The project follows a systematic approach involving:

- Data Collection: Gathering the data from Kaggle.
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and erroneous data.
- Data Preprocessing: Transforming data for better performance and accuracy.
- Data Visualization: Analyzing patterns through graphical representations like correlation heatmaps.
- Modeling: Applying regression algorithms to predict house prices.

  ## Machine Learning Models Used
1. Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a simple and widely used regression algorithm that establishes a linear relationship between independent variables and the target variable (house prices).

2. Random Forest Regression
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method used for both classification and regression. In this project, it was used to predict house prices by averaging predictions from multiple decision trees.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python: Programming language used to build and train the models.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Seaborn: For data visualization, particularly for heatmaps.
- Matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizing the data.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict house prices with a good level of accuracy. By using linear regression and random forest models, we were able to predict house prices based on various features. The results indicate that machine learning can assist in making more informed decisions in the real estate industry.

## Future Work
Use more complex models like XGBoost or Gradient Boosting to further improve the prediction accuracy.
Include more features in the dataset, such as crime rate, distance from major landmarks, etc.
Deploy the model as a web application for users to input data and predict house prices interactively.
